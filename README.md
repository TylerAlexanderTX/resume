# Resume

This project was (originally) generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.2 and [Angular](https://angular.io) version 7.2.5. It is now on Angular 13.

## Development

All the meat of the code is in the `app.component.html` file. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Publish (for myself in the future because I will forget)

Run `ng build --prod` to build the project for publishing. Clone the `TylerAlexander.github.io` directory locally. Copy the files from the `dist/` directory into the `TylerAlexander.github.io` folder. Push the changes to a new branch to test out before merging to master.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
